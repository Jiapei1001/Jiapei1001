### Hi there 👋

My name is JP. I am pursuing a path as a software developer. I am driven by curiosities. I believe in lifelong continuous learning.

🧬 I'm proficient in Java, SQL, Go, Python. I build up foundational knowledge in Algorithms, Object Oriented Design & Programming, Database Management, Cloud Computing, Scalable Distributed Systems, Mobile App Development, Computer Vision, etc.

👔 I have professional experience working as a product developer at a core R&D team. I plan ahead of schedule, listen carefully, deliver quality work, look for alternative approaches. I have records of being a collaborative, responsible and contributing team member. 

🧗‍♂️ It was a bit winding. I'm on the road.  🚴‍♂️
